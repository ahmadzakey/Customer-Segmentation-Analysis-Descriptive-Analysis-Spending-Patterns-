# 🛒 **Customer Segmentation Analysis Project**

## 📌 **Objective**  
Analyze customer demographics and spending behavior using **descriptive statistics**, **visualizations**, and **distribution analysis**. The project aims to uncover insights into customer segments and spending patterns, focusing on:  
- Central tendency (**mean, median, mode**)  
- Dispersion (**variance, standard deviation**)  
- Outlier analysis
